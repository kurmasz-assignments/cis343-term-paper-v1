# Programming Languages Term Paper

We have learned this semester about the processes of creating and evaluating
programming languages. As a culminating project in this endeavor, you will
write a term paper on a particular language.  This paper will be 5-7 pages long
(not including title pages, contents, references, appendices, etc.) and must
have a minimum of 5 sources.

You are not allowed to choose any language you have studied in this class or 
any other course. You also may not choose a
language you already know; this project is all about cementing the process of
learning a new language.  Languages that are off limits include:

  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - Typescript
  - C/C++
  - Ruby
  - Scheme (any dialect)
  - Markup languages (no HTML, XML, etc.).
  
Only two people can choose any given language, so have a backup or two in mind.  Some suggestions include

  - ML 
  - Haskell
  - F#
  - Clojure 
  - Erlang
  - Scala
  - Lua
  - Swift
  - Rust
  - Go
  - PHP
  - Julia
  - Ada
  - Groovy
  - Smalltalk
  - Pascal
  - Kotlin
  - Python
  - ~~C#~~
  - Swift

One suggestion is to choose a language you want to learn anyway but have not
gotten around to yet -- this can give you the motivation! Or, some people like
to choose a zany (but usable) language that piques their interest. Just be sure that there
is enough information available to write a substantial paper on the language.

The language **must** be approved by me before you begin.
Send me an email (1) specifying the language you want to investigate, and (2) 
affirming that you have not done any work in this language before.
Be sure that I respond before you start writing. Please email me by 
**Thursday, 16 March**. Only two people can choose any given language, so have a backup or two in mind.

## Required Sections

The final paper should include the following topics:

### Introduction

  - Provide the history of the language
  - Note the programming paradigm(s) supported
  - Address the domains in which it is widely used

### Data Abstractions

  - Note the data types the language provides
    - Clearly identify which are part of the language, and which are provided as part of the language's standard library.
    - What difference (if any) is there a difference between "primitive" data types and user-defined data types and how they are used? (For example Java doesn't allow you to use primitive types with generics.)
  - Describe the type checking system used
    - Static or dynamic?
    - Explicit or implicit?
    - When is coercion allowed? When is coercion prohibited?

### Control Abstractions

  - Describes language expressions
    - (focus on the unique / unusual)
  - Operators and precedence rules
    - (focus on the unique / unusual)
  - Selection constructs ("if" statements, switch statements, etc.)
  - Iteration
  - Functions and parameter passing techniques
    - Are parameters positional, named, or both?
    - Pass by value?  
    - Pass by reference?
    - Other?
  - Scope rules
  - Packages/Modules/Namespace capabilities
  - Exception handling

### Paradigms
  - First Class Functions
    - How are anonymous functions created / invoked
    - Any limitations?
  - Object Oriented Programming
    - Data protection
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Interfaces / abstract classes
    - Any other less common paradigms supported?

### Highlight the Distinctive Features
  - What features make this language stand out from other languages? (Are there any that are especially unique/rare?)
  - Are there any features that let you identify the language at a glance?
  - What features make this language especially well-suited for its most common use?
  - Which features do you wish were present in your favorite or most commonly used language?

### Sample Program
  - Implement Connect 4 in your language.  (I am willing to consider an alternative program, if 
    there is a good reason that the alternate program represents a better way to learn/demonstrate 
    the language.)

### Overall evaluation 

Provide an overall evaluation of the language.

  - Discuss in what ways it is readable, writable, reliable, and orthogonal.
  - Discuss in what ways its readability, writability, reliability, and orthogonality fall short.
  - Discuss tradeoffs made by the language.
  - In what ways was this language a good choice for implementing Connect 4?
  - In what ways was this language a bad choice for implementing Connect 4?

## Hints

We have discussed Readability, Writability, and Reliability in this class, as well as tradeoffs.  These ideas should show up throughout your paper (not just in the evaluation section).

It is a good idea to use code samples to demonstrate language features.  If the code sample is more than 10 lines of code it should go in an appendix and will not be counted toward the overall length.

Do not include the entire Connect 4 source code in the paper. Include only enough code to illustrate the point being made.

## Submission

Place your Connect 4 implementation and your paper **as a .pdf** in your GitHub Classroom repository.

Use this link to create a repo: [https://classroom.github.com/a/EIlRzIf_](https://classroom.github.com/a/EIlRzIf_)

## Evaluation

You will have up to two opportunities to revise your paper.

In order for me to read your entire paper and provide feedback on the content, 
  1. Your paper must be substantially complete. (For example, don't submit a rough-draft-quality paper to see if you get enough Ms for a grade you are willing to live with.)
  2. Your writing must meet general college-level standards.  For example:
     - Clarity: Sentence structures should be easy to follow, writing should flow from sentence to sentence and paragraph to paragraph.
     - Technical: Your paper should demonstrates control of language with few lapses in diction, syntax, and grammar.
     - Errors: Errors that are present do must not interfere with meaning or understanding. (Errors also must be fixed in the following submission.)

The outline above contains 24 topics.  Each item will be marked with E, M, P, or X.  Your sample code will also receive an E, M, P, or X.  The criteria for each letter grade is as follows:

- D:
  - Sample Code: P
  - Overall Evaluation: M
  - Categories: At least 16 Ms (or better); at least 21 Ps (or better)

- C:
  - Sample Code: M
  - Overall Evaluation: M
  - Categories: At least 18 Ms or better; at least 22 Ps (or better)

- B:
  - Sample Code: M
  - Overall Evaluation: M
  - Categories: At least 20 Ms or better; at least 23 categories P or better

- A:
  - Sample Code: M
  - Overall Evaluation: M
  - Categories: At least 22 Ms or better; All 24 categories P or better
  - Two revisions, maximum

I suggest you have a complete, polished draft ready to submit by ***Wednesday, 12 April***.
Your final submission is due by ***Monday, 24 April, at <u>8:00 a.m.</u>***.
It could take up to 72 hours to receive feedback from a submission.  Plan accordingly. 
(For example, if you submit a revision on Friday, 21 April, I may not have time to 
 provide feedback by the final deadline.  Similarly, if you don't make your first complete 
 submission by 12 April, there may not be enough time to make two sets of revisions. 

Your final letter grade in the course will be at most one letter grade higher than your 
letter grade on this term paper.
